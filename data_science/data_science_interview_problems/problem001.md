# Problem:
Disney+ offers a 7-day free trial period. After 7 days, customers are charged whatever package they chose. Assume that there are customers who commit to Disney+ right away and therefore don't end up having a 7-day free trial period.
Disney wants to measure the success of the free trial. What metrics and analysis might you do to determine whether or not the free trial successfully acquires new customers?


### Knowledge points: 
Metrics, A/B testing

### Potential solution hint:
The problem are about to analyze free trial Conversion rate. The metric could be percentage of users subscribed (not free trial) in a period in two different group
To do A/B testing,
We could choose the period are the durations (7 days, 14days, 1month). The control group are the users that see only an immediate payment-first approach (without a trial). The treat group is the same amount of users who see 7-day free trial first only.
We observe the percentage of users subscribed in two groups are same or not with two-sided hypothesis testing.
