# Problem

We have N observations for some variable which we model as being drawn from a Gaussian distribution. What are your best guesses for the parameters of the distribution? Derive it mathematically.


### Knowledge point

Maximum Likelihood Estimation


### Potential solution hint:

There are N observations from a population assuming being drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The population distribution is assumed to be normal distribution $\mu_0$ and $\sigma_0$

$$f(x_i) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{0}\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x_i-\mu_{0}}{\sigma_{0}})^2}$$
